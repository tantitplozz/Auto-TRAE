# PCI DSS Compliance Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for ensuring the Enterprise Autonomous Purchase System complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

## 1. Scope of Compliance

- **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE):** The CDE is strictly limited to the backend services responsible for payment processing. This includes the payment gateway integration, temporary data handling, and any related logging.
- **Out of Scope:** The Python AI agents, frontend application, and task queue system do not store, process, or transmit cardholder data and are considered out of scope. Network segmentation will be used to isolate the CDE.

## 2. Key Requirements and Implementation

- **Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data:**
  - **Strategy:** Do not store any sensitive cardholder data (e.g., full PAN, CVV2) post-authorization. We will use a tokenization solution provided by our payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Braintree).
  - **Implementation:** The backend will receive a one-time token from the payment provider's client-side library. This token, not the raw card data, will be used for transactions.

- **Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data:**
  - **Strategy:** All data transmission over open, public networks will use strong cryptography and security protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
  - **Implementation:**
    - All API endpoints will be served over HTTPS.
    - Communication between the backend and the payment gateway will be encrypted.
    - Internal network traffic between services will also be encrypted where necessary.

- **Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications:**
  - **Strategy:** Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and implement a vulnerability management program.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Regular code reviews and security scanning (SAST/DAST).
    - Dependency scanning to identify and patch vulnerable components.
    - A formal change control process for all modifications to the CDE.

- **Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components:**
  - **Strategy:** Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. Access to the CDE will be strictly controlled and based on the principle of least privilege.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data and functions.

- **Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data:**
  - **Strategy:** Implement logging and monitoring to track all user activities and detect potential security incidents.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Centralized logging for all CDE components.
    - Real-time alerting for suspicious activities.
    - Regular log reviews.

## 3. Payment Gateway Integration

- We will integrate with a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant payment service provider.
- The integration will use their client-side libraries and tokenization services to ensure that sensitive cardholder data never touches our servers directly.

## 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Compliance is an ongoing process. We will implement continuous monitoring of our security controls and conduct periodic risk assessments and penetration testing.
